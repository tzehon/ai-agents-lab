# ðŸ¦¹ Agent architectures

AI agents can consist of a single LLM as the decision maker or multiple LLMs (or same LLM, different prompts) working together to solve complex problems.

Let's look at a few different agent architectures:

## Tool-calling

This is the architecture most agents start with. It consists of a single LLM that has access to several tools to perform a range of tasks.

If you start with tool-calling agents, but upon thorough evaluation find that you need a more sophisticated architecture, only then consider multi-agent architectures. Bear in mind that fully autonomous multi-agent workflows mean higher costs, latency, and a system that is hard to debug, so use them with caution. 

## Supervisor

In this architecture, a single agent (supervisor) interfaces with a group of agents to determine the next course of action.

## Network

In this architecture, each agent can communicate with every other agent and decide which one to call next or end the execution.

## Custom

In this setup, you can decide which agents can interact with each other and how the control flows between them.
