# 👐 Create your account

:::caution
If you are doing this lab as part of a MongoDB GenAI Developer Day, at this point you should already have a free cluster, so you can skip this step and continue <a href="../dev-env/dev-env-setup">setting up the dev environment</a> for the lab.

If you don't have a cluster yet, follow the steps below to create one.
:::

In this lab, you will learn how to use MongoDB Atlas Vector Search.

To use MongoDB Atlas, you will need to start by creating an account.

<details>
  <summary> 🦹‍♀️ If you already have an Atlas account, you can use it by creating a new project.</summary>

    First, log into <Link to="https://account.mongodb.com/">MongoDB Atlas</Link> using your existing credentials.
