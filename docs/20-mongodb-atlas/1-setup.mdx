:::caution
If you are doing this lab as part of a MongoDB GenAI Developer Day, at this point you should already have a free cluster, so you can skip this step.

If you don't have a cluster yet, follow the steps below to create one.

In this lab, you will learn how to use MongoDB Atlas as a knowledge base as well as a memory provider for an AI agent that can help you understand technical documentation.

To use MongoDB Atlas, you will need to create an account, a free cluster and obtain the connection string to connect to your cluster. Follow these steps to get set up:

* [Register for a free MongoDB Atlas account](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/mongodb-atlas/create-account)

* [Create a new database cluster](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/mongodb-atlas/create-cluster)

* [Obtain the connection string for your database cluster](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/importing-data/get-connection-string)
